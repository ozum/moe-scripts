# Description

CLI toolbox for common scripts for JavaScript / TypeScript projects. Inspired by ["Tools without config"](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/automation-without-config-412ab5e47229)
and [kcd-scripts](https://github.com/kentcdodds/kcd-scripts)

# Beware

**Build yours using [script-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-helper).**

Instead of using this toolbox directly, consider creating yours using [script-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-helper).
This library is an example usage for [script-helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/script-helper) and not meant for general use.

If it fits you, fork it, because it may change from version to version according to needs of author.

# Synopsis

```
> npx moe-scripts build
```

# Details

### tslint.json

It is extendible via:

```json
{ "extends": "moe-scripts/tslint.json" }
```

Note: `tslint.json` is not a symbolic link in source root. There is no safe place to link it, because `lib` is not always available in source and `src` is not available in npm package.
